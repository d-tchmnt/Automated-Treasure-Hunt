We create a simulation of sea, in which different kind of ships move. Each kind of ship has a different function depending on each kind(ie piracy ship steals gold from others, trading ship,  . While they move in different areas of a simulated area, there are random generated conditions (such as strike of a weather, or treasure). After each round, the map conditions change. The simulation ends when every ship is sank or if a ship gathers a certain ammound of gold.
