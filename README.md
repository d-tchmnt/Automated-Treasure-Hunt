Abstract
We create a simulation of sea, in which different kind of ships move. Each kind of ship has a different function depending on each kind(ie piracy ship steals gold from others, trading ship,  . While they move in different areas of a simulated area, there are random generated conditions (such as strike of a weather, or treasure). After each round, the map conditions change. The simulation ends when every ship is sank or if a ship gathers a certain ammound of gold.

Map and Ship Classes

Every point of the map is a class object with the following variables: Weather velocity (int value between 1 and 10), Has Tresure (Bool Value) and Is_dock( Bool Value)
